###### These are my style guides. 

I've thought quite carefully about these:

* [README Style Guide](/readme/)
* [Site Pattern Primer](/pattern-primer/)
* [Post Markdown Styles](/markdown/)
* [Writing Style Guide](/writing/)

Other people have thought carefully about the following:

* [Ruby on Rails Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/rails-style-guide)
* [Roodi](https://github.com/martinjandrews/roodi#readme) checks for design issues
* [Reek](https://github.com/kevinrutherford/reek/wiki/code-smells) checks for 'code smells'
* Javascript -- [@unboxed](https://github.com/unboxed/Javascript-Style-Guide)'s and [@chamnap](https://github.com/chamnap/javascript_style_guide)'s look like decent starting points.
