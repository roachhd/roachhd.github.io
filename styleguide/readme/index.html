#### A Style Guide for README files

## Contents

The `README.md` file and supporting documents should describe the following, in this order. If the file starts getting long, break it into pieces

* **Project Titles** as a level-1 heading
  - with descriptive tagline: I should be informed and intrigued. Examples:
    - "Sinatra is a DSL for quickly creating web applications in Ruby with minimal
effort"
    - "Rails is a web-application framework that includes everything needed to create
database-backed web applications according to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern."
    - "Resque (pronounced like "rescue") is a Redis-backed library for creating
background jobs, placing those jobs on multiple queues, and processing
them later."

* **Overview**
  - what it does
  - why you might want to use it, and why you might not

* **Example Usage**: a basic example. Nothing fancy -- put rich examples in the detailed usage section

* **Getting Started**
  - installation & prerequisites
  - how to run examples and tests
    - include a `Procfile` to start any necessary servers or daemon processes
  - location of:
    - code
    - issue tracker
    - wiki
    - blog posts, screencasts, etc
    - compiled documentation (add the project to [rdoc.info](http://rdoc.info))
    - travis-ci results
    - mailing list

* **Design Goals**
  - lightweight or full-featured?
  - performance, flexibility, expressiveness?

* **Detailed Usage**
  - models and interface
  - examples
  - configuration
  - middleware or plugins
  - how it works

* **Comparable Tools**

* **Developer info**
  - Important Components
  - layout of internal code tree
  - Limitations and known issues
  - performance and benchmarking

* **Colophon**
  - Credits -- everyone who has contributed code, libraries from which we've borrowed code.
  - Copyright and License -- state the license type (typically "Apache 2.0" or "All Rights Reserved and Confidential") and refer to the `LICENSE.md` file. Don't paste the license contents in here.
  - How to contribute
  - References

## Formatting

* Call the file `README.md`.
* Write in markdown format.
  - You should use triple backtick blocks for code, and supply a language prefix:

        ```ruby
        def hello(str)
          puts "hello #{str}!"
        end
        ```

* Do not wrap lines. In emacs, enable the `longlines-mode` to make your document word wrap intelligently.




## Supporting Documentation

Besides a `README.md`, your repo should contain a `CHANGELOG.md` summarizing major code changes, a `LICENSE.md` describing the code's license (typically Apache 2.0 for our open-source projects, All Rights Reserved for internal projects), and a `notes/` directory that is a git submodule of the project's wiki. See the [style guide for repo organization](https://github.com/roachhd/style_guide/blob/master/style-guide-for-repo-organization.md) for more details.
