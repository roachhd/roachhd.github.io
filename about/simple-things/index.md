## The Simple Things I Love

###### By Katie Ball

* Quiet mornings.
* Sing-a-long songs with my kids in the car.
* A bright pink sunset.
* Cuddling up and watching a DVD with the kids.
* Walking outside with my son after it rains.
* My "life" talks with my daughter in the car.
* Making games and websites in my pajamas.
* Feeling sick and lying in bed all day without having to call my boss.
* Showing my kids a clear starry sky.
* Cheering my kids on in their footy games.
* Time alone with a good book.
* Freshly brewed coffee.
* My hot veggie soup on a cold day.
* Writing before the sun rises.
* Fresh, cold berries.
* A long conversation with a friend.
* Succumbing to a mid-afternoon nap.
* Playing in the yard with my kids.
* The feeling of satisfaction after a workout.
* Waking up to a clean, uncluttered living room.
* Laughing at my son's wacky sense of humor.
* Screaming my head off when the Tiges scores a goal.
* Collapsing after finishing a marathon, exhausted but proud.
* Spending time with my mum and sister on a Saturday afternoon.
* Letting a rich dark chocolate melt in my mouth.
* A long hot shower.
* Walking with the sand between my toes as the sun goes down.
* Listening to the sound of waves lapping a white sand beach.
* A hug when I need it.
* Dew on the grass in the morning.
* The way the dogs gets excited when he sees me, whether it has been 5 minutes or 5 hours.
