  <h1 class="big thin">What I Love</h1>

  <p>
    I work at <a href="https://roachhd.com">Roach Haus</a>. When I'm not
    doing that, I'm usually <a href="http://roachhd.github.io/Notepad">blogging</a>,
    hacking on <a href="https://github.com/roachhd">open source</a>,
    building new products (like <a href="http://github.com/ios7-css-ui.com">iOS7 CSS UI</a>)
    and learning new things. I'm a rather good at Javascript and CSS (also a wiz with Adobe 
    Creative Cloud), but kinda know something about ruby, Python and Java too. I also co-created
    two little people and care for 2 fury kids also. I live happily in Melbourne, Australia and 

    never want to leave!
