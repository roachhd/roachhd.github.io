<section>
<p>Sometimes it's fun to look back and remember what we learned and believed as kids. All the more fun when what we believed was completely random.</p>

<p>As a child growing up in Melbourne I loved football and especially my Tigers. When I was 3 years old they had won 10 premiership 🏆 (*in of 2014 this number, unfortunately remained the same).</p>

  <ul>
    <li>When I was five I wanted to be a flying horse when I grew up o_0</li>
    <li>blah blah blah </li>
  </ul>

<blockquote>PS. Extra facts from my mother in law, when she was ten she learned about sex. She learned that you have to do it 3 times to get a baby!</blockquote>
