<section>

<p>It's fun to look back and remember what we learned and believed as kids. Sometimes I was so random.</p>

    <h3>I Learned</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Boys have cooties.</li>
            <li>My 64kB <a hreg="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64" target="_blank">Commodore 64</a> had superior  technology!</li>
            <li>You should never wake a sleepwalker. The shock will kill them.</li>
            <li>If you play with a piece of bread for long enough it turns back into dough.</li>
            <li>Saying "Barley" made you <strong>untouchable</strong>
     
        </ul>

    <h3>Kid Ideas</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I wanted to marry my dog (probably not a bad choice).</li> 
            <li>I wanted to be a flying horse, just like <a href="http://www.toonarific.com/show.php?prodstudio_id=77&show_id=2197" target="_blank">Luno</a>.</li>
            <li>The Tigers are going to win the Grand Final this year (I still suffer from this delusion).</li>

        </ul>
