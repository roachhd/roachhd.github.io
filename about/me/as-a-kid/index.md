title: "When I Was A Kid"

<section>
<p>Sometimes it's fun to look back and remember what we learned and believed as kids. All the more fun when what we believed was completely random.</p>

<p>As a child growing up in Melbourne I loved football and especially my Tigers. When I was 3 years old they had won 10 premiership üèÜ (*in of 2014 this number, unfortunately remained the same).</p>

  <ul>
    <li>When I was five I wanted to be a flying horse when I grew up. Just like [Lumo](http://www.toonarific.com/show.php?prodstudio_id=77&show_id=2197)</li>
    <li>My 64kB <a hreg="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64" target="_blank">Commodore 64</a> was the most technologically advanced personal computer out there! </li>
    <li>The Atari changed **everything**</li>
  </ul>

<blockquote>"Oh winged horse of marble white, take me on a magic flight". </blockquote>
