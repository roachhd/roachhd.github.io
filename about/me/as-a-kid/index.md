title: "When I Was A Kid"

<section>

 <p>It's fun to look back and remember what we learned and believed as kids. Sometimes I was so random.</p>

    <h3>I Learned</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Boys have cootees.</li>
        <li>My 64kB <a hreg="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64" target="_blank">Commodore 64</a> had superior  technology!</li>
        <li>You should never wake a sleepwalker. The shock will kill them.</li>

      </ul>


    <h3>Other Kid Stuff</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>I wanted to be a flying horse when I grew up. Just like [Lumo](http://www.toonarific.com/show.php?prodstudio_id=77&show_id=2197)</li>
         <li>As a child growing up in Melbourne I loved football and especially my Tigers. When I was 3 years old they had won 10 premierships. Now it's almost 2015 and the total number of premierships remaines the same #GoTiges).</li>

      </ul>
