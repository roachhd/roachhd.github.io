  <p>
    Katie works at <a href="https://roachhd.com">Roach Haus</a>. When she's not
    doing that, she's <a href="http://roachhd.github.io/Notepad">blogging</a>,
    hacking on <a href="https://github.com/roachhd">open source</a>,
    building new products (like <a href="http://github.com/ProjectHub.com">Project Hub</a>)
    and learning new things. She has proficiency in Javascript and CSS (also a wiz with Adobe 
    Creative Cloud), but also knew something about ruby, Python and Java. Katie is
    a mum to 2 beautiful kids and 2 fury ones and lives happily in Melbourne, Australia.

    Katie used to have a pretty, bad-ass but super bloated curriculum here,
    but, well, there is so much places to update. So, check this for everything.
