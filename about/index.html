  <p>
    I work at <a href="https://roachhd.com">Roach Haus</a>. When I'm not
    doing that, I'm usually <a href="http://roachhd.github.io/Notepad">blogging</a>,
    hacking on <a href="https://github.com/roachhd">open source</a>,
    building new products (like <a href="http://github.com/ios7-css-ui.com">iOS7 CSS UI</a>)
    and learning new things. I'm a rather good at Javascript and CSS (also a wiz with Adobe 
    Creative Cloud), but kinda know something about ruby, Python and Java too. I also co-created
    two little people and care for 2 fury kids also. I live happily in Melbourne, Australia and 

    never want to leave!

    I used to have a pretty bad-ass and super bloated resume here,
    but well, there is so many places to update. So, check this site everything important
    <a href="http://katieball.me/">
      KatieBall.me
    </a>. You can also send me an <a href="mailto:katie@roachhd.com;">email</a> or a tweet
    at <a href="http://twitter.com/meatball">twitter</a> I love getting tweets!
