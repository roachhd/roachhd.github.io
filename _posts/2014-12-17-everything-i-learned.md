title: These are the things I learned
---


Most of what I really need to know about how to live, and what to do and how to be, i learned as a kid.
Maybe adults should forget all their complicated rules and listen to themselves.

**These are the things I learned**.

- Share everything.
- Play fair.
- Don't hit people.
- Put things back where you found them.
- Clean up your own mess.
- Don't take things that aren't yours.
- Say you're sorry when you hurt somebody.
- Wash your hands before you eat.
- Flush, then wash.
- Warm cookies and cold milk are good for you.

**Live a balanced life**.

You need to learn some and think some, And draw and paint and sing and dance.
And play and work everyday some. Also, take a nap if your tired.

**When you go out into the world**.

You should watch out for traffic, hold hands and stick together.
And don't forget to be aware of wonder.
