So I decided to leave the shackles of Go Daddy hosting behind me and set forth upon a journey into open source. 
Free, stable, fast hosting via GitHub pages is a fanatic way to deploy a website. Did I mention it's free! 

SDK here is where you will find links to all my work, websites, games, projects etc. I also have a notepad/blog kinda thing going. It's a page for me to collect all the important articles, references, notes etc for development. I wrote about stuff I know, am learning about. It contains a lot of workflow process and links to awesome resources. Some great inspiration and starting points for development. It's mostly for me use, but it might be handy to others too.

I also have links to my open source projects (click the little rocket üöÄ in there menu. There's only a few things there now, I still have a lot of work moving all my demos, projects and sites from hosting hell to hosting heaven.  

I will be updating and moving off posts and projects off the next month. 

I‚ù§Ô∏è Jekyll and GitHub.
