<section class="content about">

<p>How we treasure the firsts,</p>

<p>unaware of the last,</p>

<p>so sweet yet too fleeting.</p>

<p>Only remembering the past,</p>

<p>hang on to every waking light,</p>

<p>as they are quietly leaving.</p>

<p>There will always be an end,</p>

<p>so hug tightly to everyday,</p>

<p>Short and tense as they can be,</p>

<p>for they will be gone in a whisper</p>

<p>no one will ever disagree</p>

<p>never surrender the love for a child</p>

<p>no matter how tender, </p>

<p>no matter how wild</p>
