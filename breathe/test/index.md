### A practical philosophy book (less intellectual and more framework for decisions) by Colin Wright.

# You Only Live Once

> You have exactly one life in which to do everything you will ever do.
> Act accordingly.

Act accordingly means different things to different people, whether that's jumping out of planes or
reading fiction. The philosophy is meant to guide you to refocus on what's personally important.

#### Freedom as a Focus

Work towards increasing your level of freedom to have more options available to yourself. Then use
the current context to make the best decisions.

The best rules will increase your level of freedom. They'll guide you instead of forcing an option
onto you.
