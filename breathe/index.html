<!--  <h1 class="big thin">Breathe</h1> -->

    <p>If you feel overwhelmed, breathe. It will calm you and release the tensions.</p>

    <p>If you are worried about something coming up, or caught up in something that already happened, breathe. It will bring you back to the present.</p>

    <p>If you are moving too fast, breathe. It will remind you to slow down, and enjoy life more.</p>

    <p>Breathe, and enjoy each moment of this life.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">These are the things I’ve heard and read that help me work, live, and think. The things that shape my work and remind me that everything is going to be ok. And, of course, the things that make me smile. And they’re all from the pens and lips of those much smarter than I could hope to become.</p>
